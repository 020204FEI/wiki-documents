## Description

### Low Power LoRa® Transceiver

Benefiting from Semtech's LR1110, the Wio-Tracker 1110 Dev Board provides long-distance, low-power LoRa® communication. To learn about Long Range and its features such as network architecture and applications, you can check out An introduction of LoRa® and LoRaWAN® technology, It explains what Long Range is, how it works, and its pros and cons.

### Multiple positioning technologies

The Wio-Tracker 1110 Dev Board integrates Multi-Purpose Radio Front-End Targeting Geolocation Purposes. It's equipped with GNSS dedicated to outdoor positioning, as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning for indoor positioning. It's able to automatically transition between outdoor and indoor activities, replacing the need to build different trackers for indoor or outdoor use, this provides all-around location coverage while reducing complexity and cost.

### Rich peripherals

In addition to the onboard TH sensor and 3-axis Accelerometer, it features a series of peripheral interfaces, and supports ADC/UART and IIC transmission protocols, which can be connected to 400+ Grove modules, enabling easy upgrades to smarter solutions.


### Develop User Applications

Wio-Tracker 1110 Dev Board is a fully open-source powerful IoT development platform, compatible with Arduino IDE,  It comes with a set of example applications and code samples to help you get started smoothly and quickly.
