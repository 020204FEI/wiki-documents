## Getting Started

To get you up and running quickly, we'll be using a 2.13-inch ePaper and a XIAO ESP32S3 for this guide. If you're working with ePapers of different sizes, you can find the demo code specific to those on their respective product pages.

STEP 1: Insert the ePaper into the FPC Connector: Carefully slide your 2.13-inch ePaper into the 20-pin FPC connector on the ePaper Breakout Board.

STEP 2: Insert the XIAO ESP32S3 into the XIAO Socket: Align the pins and gently insert your XIAO ESP32S3 into the XIAO socket on the board.

STEP 3: Download the Demo Code: Navigate to the [demo code repository](https://github.com/peterpanstechland/e-ink) and download the code for your specific eInk Screen and use Arduino IDE to flash onto your XIAO EESP32S3. Follow the instructions in the repository to upload the code.

And there you have it! You're now ready to start exploring the endless possibilities with your ePaper Breakout Board and XIAO ESP32S3.
