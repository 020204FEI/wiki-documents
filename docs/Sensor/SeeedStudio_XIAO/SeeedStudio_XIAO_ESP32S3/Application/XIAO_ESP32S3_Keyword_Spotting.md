# XIAO ESP32S3 Sense & Edge Impulse Keywords Spotting

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoesp32s3_kws/1.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This tutorial will guide you through implementing a Keyword Spotting (KWS) system using TinyML on the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense microcontroller board, with the help of Edge Impulse for data collection and model training. KWS is essential for voice recognition systems, and with the power of TinyML, it's achievable on smaller, low-power devices. Let's build our own KWS system using Edge Impulse and XIAO ESP32S3 Sense!

## Getting Started

Before starting this project, please follow the preparation steps below to prepare the software and hardware needed for this project.

### Hardware

To carry out this project successfully, you need to prepare the following hardware.

- XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
- microSD card (No larger than 32GB)
- microSD card reader
- USB-C data cable

By installing the expansion board with XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, you can use the microphone on the expansion board.

Installing the expansion board is very simple, you just need to align the connector on the expansion board with the B2B connector on the XIAO ESP32S3, press it hard and hear a "click", the installation is complete.
