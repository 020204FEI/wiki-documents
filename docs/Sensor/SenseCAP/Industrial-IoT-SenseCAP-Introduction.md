## What is the SenseCAP Ecosystem?

As [Seeed Industrial IoT product](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/) category now includes many new products catering to different IoT scenarios, we've noticed some customers don't know which products to choose for meeting their needs in particular IoT applications.

<!-- ###### _(SenseCAP Product & Service Category)_ -->

As a Seeed product series, SenseCAP consists of different hardware and software services, as you can see from the graph above. [SenseCAP](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-c-1339.html) is specifically designed for serving Industrial IoT needs of wireless sensing, with the main applications in smart agriculture, smart city, and other environmental sensing scenarios.

Since 2018, we have been putting the accumulated resources, experience, and expertise into creating IIoT products for various environmental monitoring occasions. And we’ve spent months on putting the products into field tests in different countries and regions before making them generally available.

Currently, the SenseCAP IoT collection consists of [SenseCAP LoRaWAN Gateways](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=gateway&categories=SenseCAP~LoRaWAN%20Device~Gateway), [LoRaWAN Sensors](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=S210x), [4G Sensor Hub/Data Logger](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=datalogger), and [Meteorological Sensors](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/new-release-sensecap-one-industrial-grade-compact-weather-stations-for-meteorological-monitoring/). Other than hardware, we also provide software & Cloud services including SenseCAP API, SenseCAP APP, SenseCAP Portal, and SenseCAP Dashboard for easily managing the devices and data. Please see more details below.

### LoRaWAN Series


<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/102991154/wiki%20images/sensecap%20application%201.png" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></p>


LoRaWAN series comprise sensors and gateways which support LoRaWAN protocol and are LoRaWAN certified. These products are suitable for applications that need the wireless transmission of data across ultra-wide distance – 9.6 km in line of sight scene and 2 km in urban scenes, [according to our testing](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/how-we-tested-the-long-range-communication-of-seeeds-industrial-iot-product-sensecap-lorawan-series/). As well, the low power consumption features support a battery lifespan of an average of 3 years, some sensor nodes can last more than 8 years depending on the sensors’ power consumption.
