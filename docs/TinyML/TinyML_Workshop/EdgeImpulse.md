## Edge Impulse

Edge Impulse is the leading development platform for machine learning on edge devices, free for developers, and trusted by enterprises worldwide.

* With Edge Impulse, software developers, engineers, and domain experts can solve real problems using machine learning on edge devices without a Ph.D. or advanced embedded engineering skills. From getting started to MLOps in production, Edge Impulse provides maximum efficiency and speed on a wide range of hardware from MCUs to CPUs.

With EdgeImpulse we can 
* Collect dataset from the device direclty 
* Collect dataset from other source like .zip file, via api or other third party cloud ingestion 
* Create test and train data and put them in different lables  
* Train our model 
* Able to Select approriate ML algoirthms - EI provide recommended ML algorithms based on our dataset
* Deploy it on our harware 
* TinyML project collabration with version controlling 
* and much more that helps you to build tinyML applications. 


### Quick hands-on experience

Before going through the full process of learning Edge Impulse, we provide the full pre-generated arduino libraries and you can see the results by flashing this arduino program from the sketch directly to XIAO ESP32S3 Sense.

### Available Edge Impulse libraries

We're also moving forward in parallel with making some Edge Impulse exported Arduino libraries that have been verified and edited to work directly with XIAO ESP32S3 Sense.
