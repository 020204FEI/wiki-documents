        <font size={"2.1"}>Raspberry Pi was originally designed and created by a non-profit organization in UK with the intention to promote teaching basic computer science at an affordable cost to ensure the platform was available to the widest audience possible. Several generations and models of Raspberry Pis have been released that have expanded their footprints, power and applications.<br/>
        At Seeed Studio, we provide both Raspberry Pis and complementary accessories and starter kits that can help you create projects centered around the product. Additionally, we have created numbers of tutorials in Seeed’s Raspberry Pi community where you can easily find references to build your own circuits or write your own applications.
