[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers. Containers are self-contained units that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies the process of creating, distributing, and running applications, making it easier to develop and deploy software in a consistent and reproducible manner. With Docker, developers can encapsulate their applications and ensure that they run smoothly across different operating systems and infrastructure setups, making it an invaluable tool for building portable and scalable applications, streamlining development workflows, and enabling efficient collaboration among team members.
